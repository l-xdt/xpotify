# Xpotify

This is a fresh take on Spotify, in four parts, a landing page, a login & sign-up page, and finally, the main website, in HTML, CSS & a little bit of FontAwsome.

The assets can be found: [here](https://github.com/prodev2004/spotifyHomePageClone), [here](https://github.com/Tarun-Githubs/spotify-clone) and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QoqvFboNmviGdr2qPrqR44tgq-qt192c).

## Demo

There is a demo on this project! and I'm not being indirect, here is the link: click [here](https://l-xdt.github.io/xpotify/).


## Features

- Can be used offline because it uses FontAwsome for 3 icons.

- Mostly reliant on images, also good for offline.

- You are in control of the project.

- There are many factors to change: like the color palette.

- **PS:** There is a lot of little features, I haven't gone over, so that one I will leave to the user.

## FAQ

**Now, for one last time, my fav! FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Yes! Why of-course! That is why make stuff like this and publish it onto the internet, for you to try, fail, learn from your mistakes, using our code as a place of refrence.

#### Can I host this, If I can, how?

Yes you can! With my favourite Apache Container, XAMPP! Since I have explained it 23, times (now, you can see that if you look at our reopositories). So I will skip that part because you know the drill.

So! Here is a [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to the server, XAMPP! (of-course)! And if you are struggling about you can start by hosting with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff).

And if you truly trust your web skills, you can use this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Souy), to self-host a domain.
